# 🛡️ Splunk SIEM & SOC Home Lab – Threat Hunting & Incident Response

This project demonstrates a complete **Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab** using **Splunk Enterprise** deployed on an Ubuntu VM.  
The lab simulates real-world attacks, ingests Linux logs, detects threats, correlates events, triggers alerts, and performs automated incident response.

This repository contains:
✔ SPL queries  
✔ Detection rules  
✔ Dashboard exports  
✔ Automation scripts  
✔ Threat hunting techniques  
✔ Attack simulations  
✔ Full course PDF  
✔ Evidence files
